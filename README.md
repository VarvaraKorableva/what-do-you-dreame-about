###About
A web application where you can share your dreams and wishes, and your friends can fulfill them by presenting them to you.

The application will help you choose a gift for your friend. Simply visit their page, and you will see what they would like to receive as a gift. Similarly, you can add your desired gifts to your own page, and your friend will see them and give them to you on the next occasion.

###How to run
In the repository, there are two main folders - "frontend" and "backend". To run the application, follow these steps:

Start the backend by running the command npm run start. Wait for the message "Database connected!" to appear, indicating that the backend server is running successfully.

In the "frontend" folder, run npm install to install the required dependencies.

After the installation is complete, run npm run start in the "frontend" folder. This will start the frontend application.

Once both the backend and frontend are running, the application will be accessible on port 3001.
